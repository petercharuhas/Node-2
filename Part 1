1. JWT (JSON Web Token)
A standardized token format that securely transmits information between parties as a JSON object that is digitally signed.

2. JWT Signature
The signature is a cryptographic hash that verifies the token's authenticity and ensures it hasn't been modified since creation.

3. JWT Payload Visibility
The payload is visible to anyone who has the token since it's only Base64 encoded, not encrypted, so never store sensitive data in it.

4. JWT Authentication Flow
Users receive a JWT upon successful login, then include it with subsequent requests to prove their identity and access protected resources.

5. Test Types Comparison
Unit tests check individual pieces, integration tests verify components work together, and end-to-end tests validate complete user workflows.

6. Mocks
Mocks are fake versions of dependencies that simulate behavior for testing, commonly used for external services and complex operations.

7. Continuous Integration
A development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and integrated into the shared repository frequently.

8. Environment Variables
External configuration values that store sensitive or environment-specific information outside of the application code.

9. TDD
A development approach where tests are written before code, leading to better design but requiring more initial time investment.

10. JSONSchema Value
A powerful tool for validating data structures and creating clear contracts between services.

11. Deciding What to Test
Focus testing efforts on business-critical functionality and complex logic that has the highest impact on users.

12. SQL RETURNING
A clause that retrieves data from modified rows in the same query, improving performance by avoiding additional queries.

13. WebSockets vs HTTP
WebSockets maintain persistent connections for real-time communication while HTTP uses separate request-response cycles.

14. Flask vs Express Preference
Express offers a more flexible and JavaScript-native approach to web development with excellent async support and middleware capabilities.
